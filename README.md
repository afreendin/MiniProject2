## Margin of Error
Margin of error tells you how many percentage points your results will differ from the population value. 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be wtihin 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.  It will gave you the range of values below and above a sample statistic in a confidence interval.

## Confidence Interval 
Confidence interval is the way to show what the uncertainty is with a certain statistic (from a sample or survey).  It will show the probability that a population parameter fall between two set values for a certain proportion of times. Confidence intervals measure the degree of uncertainity or certainity in a sampling method. A confidence interval can take any number of probabilities, with the most common being 95% or 99% confidence level.

## How To Find Confidence Interval
For our calculator we used `def confidenceinterval` 

## Cochran's Sample Size Formula
Cochran formula allows you to calculate an ideal sample size given a desired level of precision, desires confidence level, and the estimated proportion of the attribute present in the population. Apporpriate for situations with large populations. A sampe size provides more information about a samller population than a large one, so there's a 'correction' through which the number given by Cochran's formula can be reduced if teh whole population is small.
